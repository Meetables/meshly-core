CONITNUE SETING UP AUTH AND ADMIN WITH DATABASE-HANDLING
- algorithm: lon lat

- documentation + openapi
- JSDoc for Type Hints in JavaScript
- extract functions: e.g.: find user by [username, password, uid]
- use consts for http status codes
- unified return messages
- every http 500 code  =>  console.log the problems



IMPLEMENT

getUserByIndividualFeatures,
getUserByMongoID,           // Add this
changeUserAttributes,
mongo2object



create a param for each of them to not only remove keys, but also make it possible, to ONLY GET certain keys



don't decrypt token, use middleware

let admin change user password, if confirmed, and any attribute actually

openapi:
 - auth
 - admin
